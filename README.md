# Decentralized-Predictive-Maintenance
The development of a decentralized predictive maintenance system aims to enhance industrial equipment reliability by proactively predicting failures and providing real-time insights for maintenance. Through blockchain integration and predictive analytics, this system ensures data transparency and security, reducing downtime and maintenance costs, while significantly improving operational efficiency across various industrial applications.

## About
The Decentralized Predictive Maintenance System is a project designed to leverage blockchain and predictive analytics to create a proactive, transparent, and secure maintenance framework for industrial equipment. Traditional maintenance methods can be reactive, costly, and prone to data manipulation, often leading to unexpected equipment failures and downtime. This project addresses these challenges by building a decentralized platform where maintenance data is securely stored, tamper-proof, and accessible in real-time.

Using machine learning models, the system continuously monitors equipment health, predicts potential failures, and provides timely alerts, allowing industries to perform maintenance precisely when needed. This approach not only reduces operational costs but also maximizes equipment lifespan and enhances overall productivity. Through blockchain’s decentralized architecture, the system ensures data integrity and security, creating a trusted and efficient predictive maintenance solution adaptable across various industrial settings.
